         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Nothing in the Old Testament impunges this Doctrine; for (not only the Powers, but) the Persons of Kings, in the <hi>Jews</hi> Theocracy, were immediatly of GOD; which Coelestial Designation few now can produce. Nor in the New; for the Apostles speak, either of the Powers (not the Persons) that are (in the next of Blood and the People in our case) or of the persons, but to the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who were then the farr 3d: Minor part: And so a <hi>Disparatis nulla est illatio.</hi> Nor in Examples of Primitive Martyrs, for the Law and so the Contract was (not for, but) against them; and they were not near the Major part of the Empire.

The Estates had (by an admirable Providence in the Right, as well as Fact, of this Revolution; to stop the scruples of all) such an <hi>Extraordinary Power,</hi> which the following Discourse does demonstrate by this Deduction. All K. J's. yet remaining, right and power did accrue to the (then) Prince as the Effect of K. J's being Conquered in a Just and Solemn War, and thereafter was transferred by the Conqueror to the People; so that they were (pro tempore and as to K. J.) free and Independent States: Whereupon, having Paramount and (to K. J.) unsubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate power, they declared the Throne's Vacancy of him, and <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> King and Queen: which (since they [if anxious of final Ruine] might have Re-entred under K. J.) is, what we understand by Right of choicing the time of the Heirs succeeding.</p>
            <p>The Honour assigned a Superiour, Patron, and Judge, even after Refutation of their Rights, requires a greater Respect to the Sublimer Character of an once Crowned Head from the worst bred Pen: Wherefore nothing shall be Remembranced of the late K.

            <p>The Jesuits being of such Admirable Wit; and great power in all Corners (by the Art [in once enslaving the Souls] of being Masters of the Bodies and Estates of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) and knowing the reclusest Secrets (because Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors also) of Neighbouring Princes: it is no wonder that they became the Poles whereon, the Cruel Zeal and boundless Ambition of aspiring Monarchs, should turn over their Subjects, and (once possessing that Strength) their Neighbours. Hence, by their Execrable Counsels, Religion and Liberty lost, since the last Age, more then half ground and so became Northern indeed (being utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroyed in <hi>Hungaria, Bohemia, Austria, Silesia, Styria,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Polonia, France,</hi> the New Conquests; and <hi>Piedmont</hi>) before Popery and Slavery durst advance bare-facedly (knowing, the difficulty, of old) to attacque <hi>Britain,</hi> as the Bulwark of what remained unconquered. These Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters (having first ruined the two branches of <hi>Austria,</hi> and then, almost that of <hi>Bourbone,</hi> in pursure of bringing an universal thraldom on Europe) pitched on the late K: J: as the Riseing Sun of their Hopes to (in conjunction with <hi>France,</hi> from whom Civil Interest had broke off all others) repair their former Credit in policie, and perfect the

This Acquisition is not only Legal in the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law of Nations, but also most equitable in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Justice, which, besides what is already hinted at both in Right and Fact, is farther demonstrated by this Deduction. There is a just cause of Acquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Law of nature, when I acquire, that which was not mine, in place of what is mine, and what is due to me, and for repairing and punishing an injurious fact; from him who detained what is mine, and from whom I cannot obtain what is due tome, and who hath lesed me. For otherwayes, I could never be satisfied, the bare retention being fruitless and vain, if I have no right to use it. So when my debitor defers to pay, in lieu of my debt, I get, by Judicial Assignation, his Heretage: and exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of punishment is payment of that debt which is due to the Delict.

Right was, (before now) entirely Consummated by K. J his desertion. A Contract, Emption v.g. is said to be perfected, when (its Effential Requisits being present) <hi>jus ad rem emptam</hi> is perfectly stated in the person of the Buyer: And it is said to be Consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated when, in vertue of that Right, he obtains <hi>jus in re,</hi> or the thing bought delivered to him. Even so was the P's. Right of Conquest perfected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated according to the Law of Nations, which is a comune Contract of all Princes and consequently of K. J. also. For a Just and Solemn war against a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106894:23"/>King, (not satisfieing its causes) gives <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> O (as <hi>Livius</hi> calls it) Title to his Regal right: Acts of Capture and possession; and finally, full Victory; and that King's giving over (by desertion) all to the Victor: is the same with Tradition: and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently confers <hi>jus in re</hi> on the Conqueror.</p>
               <p>It were expedient here to clucidate how K. J. his leaving us, was a Dereliction: but since his deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not only left a real right to the Prince, but also free Liberty to the Subjects to acknowledge the same; that shall be expeded in the third Section, where both their rights are considered joyntly. Here only, a great Block shall be removed out of the way, <hi>viz.</hi> That K. J<hi>'s.</hi> going off was occasioned by Fear; and so say they, it should not prejudge him. This is wholly false in a Solemn War; since the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Kings were accused by the Prophets, and punished by God, for coming against what was done out of such a fear and compulsion<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> C. 17.</note>. For,</p>
               <p>Fear is a passion and Trepidation of the mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of some present, or certain future evil. What is done through this fear, &amp; to evite that evil, is Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous and voluntar, and so once subsists: for of two evils, to do or suffer, he voluntarly (<hi>ex post facto, &amp; pofito illo casu, licet non ab initio,</hi>) choiceth to do as the least evil, and in so farr good. <hi>Coacta voluntas etiam voluntas est</hi> sayeth the Law: And<note n="*" place="margin">

For what is done by proper force is acted only by the Forcer himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any concurrence of the Sufferer: As when a man is dragged out of his house; which cannot be said of K. J. who had full freedom, and was intreated, to stay in his Kingdoms. Moreover, what is lost through fear, stands firm, and is not subject, no not to be restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in integrum,</hi> on two grounds principally. First f it be a vain fear: Secondly, tho the fear be not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106894:24"/>vain, if the cause be just which occasioned it. As to the first: <hi>vanus timor</hi> is, when the fear is not such, that it would put a Moral necessity, on the most constant man, to do what is done therethrough<note n="*" place="margin">Bachov.

                  </note>, unless, at most, threatned thereby. So that fear, which would be just in a Peasant, is in Law, esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vain in a Souldier: and that which would afford restitution to a Pusillanimous man, will not be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to, as reflecting on a Nobleman. Hence, what shall we pronounce of K.

The rejecting all which gave us just fears indeed, that it was a designed total Conquest (not fear) which caused his Desertion.</p>
               <p>As to the second: Tho this fear was not <hi>vanus ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> yet the cause being just which occasioned it, <hi>viz.</hi> A Solemn War, what is lost thereby, is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable.

Their general reasons were (not only the just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of so punishing him [if it can be called any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment] for bygones, but also) at home; the new danger of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> against which K.

Wherefore the <hi>States</hi> seeing, the Justice, Necessity, &amp; Utility of Electing this time to declare the P: their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; did make that happy choice which he was graciously pleased to accept accordingly. This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention of His, was an Act of the greatest Justice, and Conscience, and Necessity of Duty and Honour; and consequently, nothing derogating from, but adding to, his former Renown and Glory.

As to the Justice of inflicting that Punishment (of useing the Right of Conquest:) The war and punishment being most just in themselves (as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven formerly) both being inferred only, after K.

But absolute Necessity engages (especially) private men, who are not able to judge a controverted Right, and ought not to prefer (in these Points of Law) their own ill infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med opinion, to the judgment of all other knowing Concitizens (since it was our consent and will, in first entering Society, that the Major part should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige each single man in those things for which that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety was institute [<hi>i. e.</hi> publick Determinations and common good] and not that there should be no pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of establishing peace and calming differences: much more when there is a new consent by choicing
