1. THESIS I. The Enterprise of the (then) P. of Orange, (a Supreme) by his Army (Forreigners) was a just War, both as to its Cause and Solemnities, or Matter and Form; and so must have all the Effects such hath had in all Ages.

1. THESIS III. But his HIGHNESS having Over-given and Resigned, any Title of Conquest, to the Subjects (after the Conquered King's Deserting them to the Conqueror, and thereby Consummating his right) the Regal Government was (pro tempore) Dissolved; and they were as free, from K: J: as if a Democracy had been Surrogate in its place.

1. THESIS IV. The now Manumitted, and so (from the late K: J:) free People, choicing to declare the (then) Prince their King, his present Possession is Founded on all the Rights that the utmost extent of Birth-right, Conquest, and Election, conjunctly or separatly, can afford: and so all his Majestie's proceedings (as grounded on immoveable Justice,) are most consistent with his Honour and Glory. As shall be demonstrated.
